## Suggested Rollout Approach

1. **Complete P0/P1/P2** (20 features) ✅ **DONE**
   - Core language evolution from C# 3.0 → 12.0
   - Modern syntax and type safety patterns

2. **Build P3** (6 features) ✅ **DONE**
   - Fill foundational gaps (Func<T>/Action<T>, Span<T>, using declarations, ref/out/in)
   - Cover 95% of typical C# development scenarios (C# 3.0+)
   - Total: 26 features

3. **Layer P4** (~20+ features) — ~3-4 weeks
   - Advanced and specialized patterns (C# 3.0+)
   - Domain-specific deep dives
   - Total: ~46+ features

4. **Ongoing** — Maintenance & updates
   - Monitor new C# releases (annually)
   - Update existing feature content with new version capabilities
   - Respond to community feedback on coverage gaps

---

## Notes

- **Coverage floor:** C# 3.0 (.NET 3.5, 2007) and forward only. Pre-C# 3.0 features out of scope.
- **P3 is critical** for comprehensive coverage and practical value
- **P4 is optional** but provides depth for specialists
- This roadmap covers ~95% of production C# usage (P0+P1+P2+P3) from C# 3.0 onward
- Remaining 5% (P4 niche features) useful for specific domains (systems programming, reflection-heavy patterns, etc.)
