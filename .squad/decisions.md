## Active Decisions

### 2026-06-17 — Directive: add version-aware feature filtering
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/copilot-directive-2026-06-17T10-22-23-592-04-00.md`

We need a filtered view so visitors can see features up to and including a specific version, or after a specific version; tagging language/.NET version on each feature is required.

### 2026-06-17 — First feature content model (`var`) is data-driven
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/clark-var-sample.md`

- Canonical feature metadata lives in `src/_data/features.js` as feature objects.
- Canonical C# snippets live under `src/code-samples/<feature>/` and are loaded with `readSnippet(...)`.
- Detail pages are generated from `src/features/feature.njk` via pagination.
- `src/features/index.md` iterates shared `features` data.

### 2026-06-17 — `var` discoverability and UI integration
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/lois-var-ui.md`

- Keep `src/_data/features.js` as source of truth for feature cards/nav generation.
- Use reusable `/features/{slug}/` page generation from `src/features/feature.njk`.
- Keep `src/features/index.md` card rendering data-driven with first-sample callout.
- Add primary nav link to first feature from `layout.njk`.

### 2026-06-17 — `var` educational content posture
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/cat-var-content.md`

- Add dedicated page at `src/features/var/index.md`.
- Explain `var` as compile-time inference (not dynamic typing).
- Provide readability-first usage guidance and misuse cautions.
- Add feature-map entry linking to `/features/var/`.

### 2026-06-17 — Build validation for `var` feature
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/jimmy-var-validation.md`

- Add `scripts/check-var-feature.mjs` and run through `npm run build` (`eleventy && npm run --silent check:var`).
- Verify source wiring, route/index references, and rendered output expectations for `/features/var/`.

### 2026-06-17 — Version tagging baseline model
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/perry-version-filtering.md`

- Adopt per-feature `versions` metadata for both `csharp` and `dotnet` with `{id,label,order}`.
- Add `src/_data/featureFilters.js` with filter modes and unique sorted version options by family.
- Filter semantics:
  - upToIncluding: `feature.versions[target].order <= selected.order`
  - after: `feature.versions[target].order > selected.order`

### 2026-06-17 — Version filter UX and URL behavior
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/lois-version-filter-ui.md`

- Drive filter state with query params on `/features/`: `target`, `mode`, `version`.
- Keep Eleventy output static; apply filtering via small client-side JS.
- Defaults/resilience: `target=csharp`, `mode=upToIncluding`, `version=latest available C# option` when params are invalid/missing.
- Accessibility: explicit labels, status summary, and empty-state messaging.

### 2026-06-17 — Deterministic validation for version filtering
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/jimmy-version-filter-validation.md`

- Extend existing `check:var` harness for version-filter metadata and rendered controls.
- Validate filter model shape (`versionFamilies`, defaults, options).
- Validate rendered controls and default script state in generated HTML.
- Keep checks deterministic and lightweight; dynamic browser interaction remains out of scope.

### 2026-06-17 — Directive: version-accurate samples and markdown content architecture
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/copilot-directive-2026-06-17T10-51-04-654-04-00.md`

Feature samples must stay accurate to the feature’s introduction-era versions unless explicitly labeled as newer capability. Feature narrative content should live in markdown files under a dedicated `features/` content folder with indexed references.

### 2026-06-17 — Feature content architecture migrated to `features/index.json`
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/clark-content-architecture.md`

- Canonical feature content moved to `features/index.json` and `features/<slug>/article.md` assets.
- `src/_data/features.js` resolves index entries into render-ready objects while preserving template-facing shape.
- Examples now carry `sampleLanguageVersion` and optional `newerCapabilityNote`.

### 2026-06-17 — `var` narrative aligned to C# 3.0 baseline
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/cat-var-version-accuracy.md`

- `features/var/article.md` is canonical narrative and now teaches C# 3.0/.NET 3.5-era baseline first.
- Baseline examples avoid newer-only syntax (e.g., target-typed `new`).
- Newer syntax is allowed only in clearly labeled optional callouts.

### 2026-06-17 — Feature page markdown-segment rendering model
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/lois-markdown-rendering.md`

- Feature content index supports segmented markdown references (`summary`, `intro`, `article`, `sections[]`, `callouts[]`).
- Detail template renders markdown segments and accessible note callouts while preserving existing list/filter and code rendering behavior.

### 2026-06-17 — Fix quick sample entity double-escaping
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/lois-escape-fix.md`

- Home quick sample expression is marked safe so markdown/highlight performs the single required escaping pass.
- Prevents `&amp;lt;`/`&amp;gt;` regressions in rendered snippets.

### 2026-06-17 — C# highlighting pipeline for feature samples
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/lois-csharp-highlighting.md`

- Feature sample rendering now uses shared `highlightCode` pipeline instead of raw escaped output.
- Added narrow C# decoration for missing token classes (type/operator/punctuation) and matching high-contrast CSS support.

### 2026-06-17 — Deterministic checks: version-structure constraints
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/jimmy-version-structure-validation.md`

- `scripts/check-var-feature.mjs` asserts markdown-backed structure and version-valid sample constraints.
- Includes explicit newer-capability labeling checks.

### 2026-06-17 — Deterministic checks: quick sample escaping
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/jimmy-escape-validation.md`

- Validation now fails on double-escaped entities in generated var feature output.

### 2026-06-17 — Deterministic checks: C# highlighting coverage
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/jimmy-highlighting-validation.md`

- Validation now asserts required highlight token spans in generated var page HTML and corresponding CSS class support.

### 2026-06-17 — Deterministic validation for newer-capabilities section and ordering
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/jimmy-newer-capabilities-validation.md`

- Extend `scripts/check-var-feature.mjs` to verify newer-capabilities source metadata and markdown references.
- Validate rendered output includes the **Newer capabilities** section and expected entries.
- Enforce ascending C# version ordering in rendered output when multiple entries exist.

### 2026-06-17 — Reorganize feature model to per-feature manifest + content subfolders
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/clark-feature-structure-reorg.md`

- Adopt `features/<slug>/feature.json` as the canonical per-feature manifest.
- Move narrative files under `features/<slug>/content/` with required paths for summary, intro, sections, callouts, and optional newer-capabilities.
- Update loader behavior to auto-discover `features/*/feature.json` and resolve markdown paths relative to each feature folder.
- Supersedes prior centralized `features/index.json` contract.

### 2026-06-17 — Add Copilot skill for website feature authoring
**Source:** `decisions/inbox/cat-feature-skill.md`

- Add `.copilot/skills/add-website-feature/SKILL.md` to codify feature authoring workflow.
